Command line tool for frequency analysis

Frequan compares the relative frequencies of the different characters of an entered string or input file, sorting them in order of frequency if prompted.

It can also attempt to decrypt alphabet-only substitution ciphers. However, this is experimental and does not work well yet.

Usage: `frequan [-i input file] [--order] [--attempt-alphabet-substitution] [--help]`
